        <p class="intro-text">
            My team is the Single Digital Ecosystem team and as for our responsibilities, we are a full-stack team who help maintaining and developing the gol-ui online groceries website. More specifically, we mainly look after Occasions by Sainsbury's (OBS) page - previously known as Food To Order (FTO) (some still refer to it as this). However, we also support the slot booking page both in home delivery + click & collect, and occasionally, we assist with Favourites page due to some team members having worked on it prior to this team

        <h2><span class="stage-title">My Role - Associate Engineer (C3)</span></h2>
        <p>
            I contribute to feature delivery on gol-ui across the tech-stack, with a focus on front-end work (at the moment). Day to day, I pick up tickets from our sprint board, follow our branching methodology, create well-tested code (unit and e2e tests), and raise PRs for review. I pair with seniors to learn patterns and review feedback, help squash bugs, and take part in stand-ups (been a sprint captain), refinement, planning and retros. I also support demos at sprint review and keep documentation (mainly GitHub) up to date when we change behaviour.
